# 🚀 The CS284 Odyssey: Data Structures at Stevens

Welcome to my digital laboratory! This repository is a living chronicle of my journey through **CS284** (Spring 2026) at Stevens Institute of Technology (Go Ducks 🦆). 

More than just a folder of code, this space documents my evolution from a student of syntax to a designer of efficient systems under the guidance of Dr. Zumrut Akcam-Kibis (Best Teacher Eva!).

## 🗺️ The Roadmap
The quest is divided into two distinct paths of mastery:

* **⚔️ The Proving Grounds (6 Programming Assignments):** Large-scale Java projects where I build robust systems, ensuring every line compiles and stands up to JUnit testing.
* **🧠 The Mental Gym (6+ Analysis Homeworks):** Deep-dives into Big-O complexity ($O(n)$) and paper-and-pencil algorithmic design.

## 🛠️ My Toolkit
* **Language:** Java ☕ 
* **Testing:** JUnit 🧪 
* **Core Concepts I'm Mastering:** * **Complexity:** Calculating Big-O to compare efficiency.
    * **Collections:** Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
    * **Non-Linear Structures:** Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and self-balancing AVL/Red-Black trees.
    * **Search & Sort:** Implementing Hash Tables and algorithms like Quick and Merge sort.
